                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
<p>The gemsbok is a large antelope of the genus *Oryx*, native to arid regions of Southern Africa, particularly the Kalahari Desert. It is known scientifically as *Oryx gazella*. Gemsbok are well adapted to dry, desert environments and are capable of surviving in extreme conditions where water is scarce. They are striking animals, recognized by their long, straight horns and distinct black-and-white facial markings. Both males and females have horns, which can grow up to 85 cm (33 in) in length.</p>

<p>Gemsbok have strong, muscular bodies with a light brown to grayish coat, contrasted by black markings on the legs, face, and along the flanks. These markings help with camouflage in their native desert habitat. Their horns are used for defense against predators and in dominance battles during mating season. Gemsbok are herbivores, feeding on grasses, roots, bulbs, and occasionally fruit. They can extract moisture from their food, allowing them to go for long periods without drinking water.</p>

<p>Typically found in open plains, savannahs, and desert dunes, gemsbok are well suited for hot, dry climates. They are most active during the cooler parts of the day, such as early morning and late afternoon.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the gemsbok at pen A14, near the desert exhibit and across from the meerkat enclosure.</p>
