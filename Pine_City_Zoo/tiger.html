                    <h3>TIGER</h3>
<p>Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and are known for their striking orange coats with black stripes. Their scientific name is <em>Panthera tigris</em>, and they are native to parts of Asia, from India and Nepal to China and Southeast Asia. Tigers are powerful, solitary predators and are revered in many cultures for their strength, beauty, and stealth.</p>

<p>Adult male tigers can weigh up to 300 kg (660 lb) and measure over 3 m (10 ft) from head to tail. Females are slightly smaller. Each tiger's stripe pattern is unique, much like human fingerprints, and helps with camouflage in the dappled light of their forest or grassland habitats. Tigers are excellent swimmers and often cool off in rivers and lakes, unlike most other big cats.</p>

<p>Tigers are carnivorous, hunting a wide range of prey including deer, wild boar, and even large animals like buffalo. They usually hunt alone, relying on stealth and strength to ambush their prey. Despite their fearsome reputation, tiger populations are under threat due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation programs are ongoing to help protect these magnificent animals in the wild.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the tigers at pen T08, in the big cat territory near the waterfall viewing area.</p>
