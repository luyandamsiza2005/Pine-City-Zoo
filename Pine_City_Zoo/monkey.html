                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
<p>Monkeys are intelligent, social primates found in many parts of the world, including Central and South America, Africa, and Asia. They belong to the order <em>Primates</em> and are typically divided into two groups: New World monkeys (from the Americas) and Old World monkeys (from Africa and Asia). There are over 260 species of monkeys, ranging in size, appearance, and behavior.</p>

<p>Monkeys are known for their agility, dexterous hands, expressive faces, and curious nature. Most species are arboreal, meaning they live in trees, though some, like baboons, spend a lot of time on the ground. They are omnivorous, feeding on fruits, leaves, seeds, insects, and small animals. Many monkeys use tools, solve problems, and exhibit complex social behaviors such as grooming, play, and cooperation.</p>

<p>Social structures among monkeys vary by species, but they often live in groups called troops, which provide protection and help raise young. Communication is essential in monkey societies, involving vocalizations, facial expressions, body language, and even scent marking. Monkeys are active during the day and are known for their high energy, making them popular and entertaining zoo residents.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the monkeys at pen M11, in the treetop habitat next to the tropical bird aviary.</p>
