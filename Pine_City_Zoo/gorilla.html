                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
<p>Gorillas are the largest living primates and belong to the genus <em>Gorilla</em>. They are ground-dwelling, herbivorous apes native to the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. There are two main species: the eastern gorilla (<em>Gorilla beringei</em>) and the western gorilla (<em>Gorilla gorilla</em>), each with subspecies including the critically endangered mountain gorilla. Known for their strength and intelligence, gorillas share about 98% of their DNA with humans.</p>

<p>Adult male gorillas, often referred to as “silverbacks” due to the silver hair that develops on their backs, can weigh up to 180 kg (400 lb) and stand around 1.7 m (5.6 ft) tall when upright. Females are smaller, generally weighing about half as much. Gorillas live in family groups led by a dominant silverback, who protects and leads the troop.</p>

<p>Gorillas primarily eat leaves, stems, fruit, and bamboo. They are diurnal, meaning they are active during the day, and they build nests on the ground or in trees for sleeping at night. Known for their gentle and shy nature, gorillas communicate through a variety of vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions. Despite their size, they are peaceful animals and only show aggression when threatened.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the gorillas at pen P05, in the rainforest zone beside the primate research center.</p>
