                    <h3>LION</h3>
<p>Lions are large carnivorous mammals belonging to the genus <em>Panthera</em>, with the species name <em>Panthera leo</em>. Often called the "king of the jungle," lions are native to parts of sub-Saharan Africa and a small population exists in the Gir Forest of India. They are known for their muscular build, deep chest, and iconic manes on males, which vary in color and size and can signify age, genetics, and dominance.</p>

<p>Adult male lions can weigh up to 250 kg (550 lb) and measure up to 3.3 m (11 ft) from head to tail. Females are smaller and more agile, usually leading the hunt. Lions are social cats, living in groups called prides that typically consist of related females, their cubs, and a few dominant males. This social structure is unique among big cats.</p>

<p>Lions are apex predators, feeding mainly on large herbivores such as wildebeest, zebras, and antelope. They use teamwork and strategic hunting techniques to bring down prey. Lions are also known to scavenge and will often take over kills made by other predators. Most active at night or during the cooler hours of the day, they spend up to 20 hours a day resting or sleeping to conserve energy.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the lions at pen L03, near the predator zone and close to the African savannah lookout point.</p>
