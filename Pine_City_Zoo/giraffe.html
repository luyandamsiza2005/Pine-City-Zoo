                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
<p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, belonging to the genus <em>Giraffa</em>. The most well-known species is the northern giraffe (<em>Giraffa camelopardalis</em>), though several subspecies and distinct species have been identified. Native to savannahs and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, giraffes are best known for their exceptionally long necks and legs, as well as their distinctive spotted coat patterns, which vary between species and individuals.</p>

<p>A fully grown male giraffe can reach heights of up to 5.5 m (18 ft) and weigh around 1,200 kg (2,600 lb), while females are slightly smaller. Their long necks allow them to browse leaves and shoots high up in trees, primarily from acacia species. Despite their height, giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as most mammals—seven—each greatly elongated. Their prehensile tongues, which can be up to 45 cm (18 in) long, help them strip leaves from branches with ease.</p>

<p>Giraffes are herbivorous and typically found in areas with plenty of trees and shrubs. They are social animals, often seen in loosely organized herds. Their long legs and powerful kick offer defense against predators such as lions. Giraffes also have unique walking and running gaits, moving both legs on one side of their body at the same time when walking, and galloping with their necks acting as a counterbalance when running.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the giraffes at pen G07, near the acacia grove and across from the observation deck.</p>
