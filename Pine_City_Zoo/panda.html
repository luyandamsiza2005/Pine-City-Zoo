                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
<p>Pandas, also known as giant pandas, are large, distinctive bears native to the mountainous forests of central China. Their scientific name is <em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>. Pandas are easily recognized by their bold black-and-white fur pattern, with black patches around the eyes, ears, shoulders, and legs. They are a national symbol of China and a global icon for wildlife conservation.</p>

<p>Adult pandas typically weigh between 70 to 160 kg (150 to 350 lb), with males being larger than females. Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas have a diet that is over 99% bamboo. They eat for up to 12 hours a day, consuming around 12–38 kg (26–84 lb) of bamboo daily to meet their energy needs. Occasionally, they may also eat small animals or eggs.</p>

<p>Pandas are generally solitary animals with a gentle temperament. They have strong jaws and molar teeth adapted for crushing bamboo. Panda cubs are born extremely small and helpless, and mothers are very protective. While once critically endangered, panda populations have started to recover due to extensive conservation efforts, though habitat loss remains a concern.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the pandas at pen P01, in the bamboo forest exhibit near the Asian Highlands section.</p>
