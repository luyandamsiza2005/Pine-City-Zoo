                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
<p>Warthogs are wild members of the pig family native to the grasslands, savannahs, and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. Their scientific name is <em>Phacochoerus africanus</em>. They are easily recognized by their large, flat heads, prominent facial warts, and curved tusks that grow from their upper jaws. Despite their somewhat intimidating appearance, warthogs are generally shy and avoid confrontation.</p>

<p>Adult warthogs typically weigh between 50 to 150 kg (110 to 330 lb). Both males and females have tusks, which they use for digging, fighting, and defense against predators. Warthogs have tough skin and sparse hair, with a distinctive mane running along their backs. They are well adapted to hot, dry environments and can survive long periods without water.</p>

<p>Warthogs are omnivores, feeding on grasses, roots, berries, and occasionally insects and small animals. They often use their snouts and tusks to dig for food and create burrows for shelter. Warthogs are known for their habit of kneeling on their front knees while grazing. They live in family groups called sounders, usually made up of females and their young, while males tend to be solitary.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the warthogs at pen W12, in the African plains area near the giraffe enclosure.</p>
