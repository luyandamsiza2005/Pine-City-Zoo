                    <h3>RHINO BEETLE</h3>
<p>Rhino beetles, also known as rhinoceros beetles, are a group of large, powerful insects belonging to the subfamily <em>Dynastinae</em>. Named for the impressive horn-like structures on the males' heads, these beetles use their horns for digging and battling rivals during mating season. Despite their fierce appearance, rhino beetles are harmless to humans and do not bite or sting.</p>

<p>Rhino beetles can grow up to 15 cm (6 in) long, making them some of the largest beetles in the world. Males are typically larger than females and possess the distinctive horns, while females lack them. Their bodies are covered in a hard exoskeleton, usually brown or black, and their wings are hidden beneath a tough pair of wing covers called elytra. Though they can fly, they are clumsy in the air.</p>

<p>These beetles are found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. As larvae, they live underground and feed on decaying plant matter for several years before pupating into adults. Adult rhino beetles feed on fruit, nectar, and sap. They are often active at night and play an important role in breaking down decomposing plant material.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the rhino beetles at enclosure I03, inside the Insect House next to the butterfly garden.</p>
