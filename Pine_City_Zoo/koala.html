                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
<p>Koalas are arboreal marsupials native to Australia, scientifically known as <em>Phascolarctos cinereus</em>. Though often called “koala bears,” they are not bears at all. Koalas are closely related to wombats and are known for their thick, grey fur, large round ears, black noses, and sleepy demeanor. They are found primarily in eucalyptus forests along the eastern and southeastern coasts of Australia.</p>

<p>Koalas are relatively small animals, with adults weighing between 4 to 15 kg (9 to 33 lb), depending on sex and region. They have strong limbs and sharp claws for climbing trees. Koalas are herbivores and feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are tough and low in nutrition. To digest this fibrous diet, they have a highly specialized digestive system, including a long cecum and a slow metabolism.</p>

<p>Koalas sleep up to 18–22 hours a day to conserve energy due to their low-calorie diet. They are mostly solitary animals, with each individual occupying its own home range. Female koalas carry their young, called joeys, in a pouch for about six months after birth, followed by several more months riding on the mother's back.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the koalas at pen K09, in the eucalyptus grove near the Australian wildlife section.</p>
